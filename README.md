# Admin-Dashboard

This site was created to showcase CSS Grid elements and properties as assigned by The Odin Project curriculum.
It is also meant to demonstrate various CSS selectors and styling, as well as usage of SVGs and images.

Nothing on this site is meant to link anywhere on the web. It is purely for demonstration and design purposes.
